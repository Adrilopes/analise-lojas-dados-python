# 🌟 Store Sales Analysis — Python Data Science Project

This project presents a complete sales analysis of four stores owned by Mr. João.
Using Python and Data Science techniques, the goal is to determine which store should be sold based on:
	•	Revenue
	•	Product category performance
	•	Best and worst-selling products
	•	Customer satisfaction
	•	Shipping cost
	•	Geographic distribution of sales

All analysis was performed in Python using Google Colab.

# 🎯 Objective of the Project

Identify which store is the least strategic to keep and should therefore be sold.

To reach this conclusion, the analysis includes:
	•	Total revenue per store
	•	Best and worst-selling categories
	•	Top and low-performing products
	•	Average customer ratings
	•	Average shipping cost
	•	Visual dashboards and charts

# Technologies Used

	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Google Colab
	•	GitHub

# ▶️ How to Run the Project
	1.	Click the “Open in Colab” button at the top
	2.	Open the notebook
	3.	Run each cell in sequence
	4.	Install dependencies if prompted

# 🧠 Final Conclusion

After analyzing all indicators — revenue, categories, product performance, ratings, shipping cost, and geography — the results show that:

Store 4 is the best candidate to be sold.

Why?
	•	Lowest total revenue
	•	Weak category and product performance
	•	Average customer rating
	•	Lowest shipping cost, but no contribution to good results
	•	Lower strategic potential compared to stores 1, 2, and 3
